# PoE Inscribed Ultimatum Regular Expression Generator
This repository is for the inscribed ultimatum regular expression generator for Path of Exile, currently up to date for Path of Exile 3.24.
This tool is intended to help facilitate bulk trading of inscribed ultimatum by generating pattern matching expressions based on selected conditions for the inscribed ultimatums.
Currently, this tool only supports regular expressions for the "Doubles Currency" reward type, as this is the most likely reward type to be bulk bought and sold, but further functionality may be added in the future.
